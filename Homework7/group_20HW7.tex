\item Simulated Annealing

\begin{description}
\item[Initial Temperature]  Looking at our original knapsack problem, we see that the best increase we could expect in the value is 1000.  We test with that value as our initial temperature extensively.
\item[Cooling]  We use both an exponential and Cauchy cooling scheme. 
\item[Probabilities] Add code here
\item[Stopping Criteria]  We first attempted to just run through a total number of iterations with a for loop, just allowing it to continue until it exhausted all possibilities in the for loop.  This had a few draw backs:  while simple, it could get stuck and take a long time.  It could also hit a piece of the logic and not find an acceptable new solution.  I quickly made an edit to the annealing code, if it could not find a suitable neighbor in 100 tries, I exited the loop.  It would then return to that loop and again attempt to find a suitable neighbor.  Since there are probabilities involved, perhaps it would not find a neighbor to move to.
